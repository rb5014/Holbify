      <h3>Play a song / Change volume / Show song information</h3>
      <p>The user by clicking on the Play button will either open a dialog to choose a file, or start again a song already loaded. Loading another song will send the previous one in a "Recent playlist", permitting the user to use the Previous/Next buttons.</p>

      <h2 id="about">About</h2>
      <p>This is a Portfolio Project for <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.fr/">Holberton School</a>, created by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/romain-bayle-48a11a243">Romain Bayle</a></p>
      <p>Since I've always played guitar, and listened to a lot of music, the idea of creating a music player to showcase my talents as a developper came naturally.</p>
         I also had to learn the C++ language for my future internship starting in March, I wanted to get a lead and be ready as soon as possible.
         Therefore, I decided to mix the two ideas into one: Creating a music player in C++.
      <p>C++ is known to be one of the most complex language, and this project confirmed it for me. It was a great challenge, and that is also what i was looking for
         when I started creating this application from scratch. 
         Not everything is perfect yet, but I will be adding more features in the future and also customize the design a little bit more.
